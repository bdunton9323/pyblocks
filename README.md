# pyblocks

This is a tetris-like game I wrote in python using the pygame library.

## Running the game

The game is self contained. To launch it, simply run:
```s
> python blocks.py
```

The default key mappings are:
 - `z` - rotate left
 - `x` - rotate right
 - `space` - drop the piece
 - `esc` - go to menu

## Dependencies
 - python 2.7
 - pygame

## TODO
 - make a virtualenv script
 - particle effects for block breaking
