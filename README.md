# pyblocks

This is a tetris-like game I wrote in python using the pygame library. This was my first major python project, so there are probably a lot of things in here I would do differently now.

## Running the game

The game is self contained. To launch it, simply run:
```s
> python game.py
```

The default key mappings are:
 - `z` - rotate left
 - `x` - rotate right
 - `space` - drop the piece
 - `esc` - go to menu

## Dependencies
 - python 2.7
 - pygame

## TODO
 - Make a virtualenv script
 - Particle effects for block breaking
 - Clean up the project structure
